## 🧠 Why I Build These Systems

Most ISP problems are not caused by hardware failure,
but by poor operations:

- No visibility
- No standardization
- No automation
- No documentation

I build systems that:
- Improve uptime
- Reduce operational risk
- Scale with growth
- Work 24/7, even when humans sleep

## 🔥 My Journey (Short Version)

Started in 2017 as a **Fiber Technician (Layer 1)**.  
Mocked as *“tukang narik kabel”*.

Instead of quitting, I upgraded:
cables → routing → monitoring → security → management.

Today, I manage **3 ISPs** and consult nationwide.

**NEVER SURRENDER** is not a slogan — it’s how I survived the industry.
